# TinyShot
Simple one click screenshots

Why I made this tool
WINDOWS SUCKS. On windows I could'nt find a simple tool, which just takes screenshots by one click. Almost every program has 2,3 click process. Keyboard shortcut Win+PrtSc is good, but the filename is Screenshot(1), Screenshot(2), and so on. I hate this awfull name scheme. On laptops you have to press Fn key too, that's another hassle.

How To Use
You will need to install it first. So grab the latest version from (here)[https://github.com/gusmeadows/TinyShot/releases].Its a simple setup.
After installing, drag the icon either from desktop or star, and pin it to taskbar. And you are done!!!.


All of your screenshots will be saved in Pictures/TS folder

The screenshots are saved as png for better quality. The name scheme is also very simple and easy to understan
