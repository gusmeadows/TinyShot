### TinyShot
Simple one click screenshots

## Why I made this tool?  
WINDOWS SUCKS. I couldn't find a simple app, which just takes screenshots by one click. Almost every program has 2,3 click process. Keyboard shortcut Win+PrtSc is good, but the filename is Screenshot(1), Screenshot(2), and so on. I hate this awfull name scheme. On laptops you have to press Fn key too, that's another hassle. And don't get me started on Snip&Sketch. You have to name each screenshot, manually save it, wtf is wrong with MS????

## How To Use  
You will need to install it first. So grab the latest version from [here](https://github.com/gusmeadows/TinyShot/releases). Its a simple setup.  
After installing, drag the icon either from desktop or star, and pin it to taskbar. And you are done!!!.


All of your screenshots will be saved in Pictures/TS folder  
The screenshots are saved as png for better quality. The name scheme is also very simple and easy to understand

Play this to understand better
